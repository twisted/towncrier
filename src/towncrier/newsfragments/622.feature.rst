``towncrier check`` will now fail if any news fragments have invalid filenames.

Added a new configuration option called ``build_ignore_filenames`` that allows you to specify a list of filenames that should be ignored. If this is set, ``towncrier build`` will also fail if any filenames are invalid, except for those in the list.
